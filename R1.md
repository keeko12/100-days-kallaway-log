## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - 4/16/2020

### Day 1: APRIL 

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts:** It feels good to be back at the computer coding again. Although I have some clocked time for HTML, CSS: restarting with freecodecamp.org for my 100 hours of code to maintain continuity in learning and progression.

**Link to work:** [Pomodoro Clock App](https://github.com/Kallaway/pomodoro-clock/commit/f7590d1e8180bd63167b04494710f27d50b13890)

**Music:** Pod Saves America

### Day 2: June 14 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More progress on the canvas of the Pomodoro Clock. Worked on CSS (still figuring out Flexbox things), have done some work with HTML5 canvas.

**Thoughts:** It's a bit frustrating to spend a lot of time figuring out how the canvas works.
